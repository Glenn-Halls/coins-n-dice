# Coins 'n' Dice
##### Allows the user to flip coins 'n' dice to their heart's content! The red and black dice can be rolled independently or together with a combined total. Similarly, the coins can be flipped on their own, or together for a game of Two-Up.
###### This project was undertaken as an extension of Android Developers' Android Basics in Kotlin - Unit 1: Kotlin Basics course, which can be found <a href="https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/unit-1">here</a>.
