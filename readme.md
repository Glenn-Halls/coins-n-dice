# Coins 'n' Dice
##### Allows the user to flip coins 'n' dice to their heart's content! The red and black dice can be rolled independently or together, displaying a combined total. Similarly, the coins can be flipped on their own, or together for a game of Two-Up. Users can reset the app to its initial state by changing from portrait to landscape, or vice-versa.
